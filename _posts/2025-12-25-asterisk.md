![Asterisk VoIP](../assets/images/asterisk/asterisk.png)

Asterisk is a free and open-source software framework that transforms an ordinary computer into a powerful communications server using Voice over IP (VoIP) and traditional telephony protocols. It enables users to build custom telephony solutions—most commonly an IP Private Branch Exchange (PBX)—without the expensive licensing fees associated with proprietary hardware.

In this post, we will demonstrate how to build a simple VoIP system within a local area network (LAN) using Asterisk on Debian. We will also use softphones to test the configuration and explain how the system works.

The setup will start with basic configurations, such as making voice calls between users on the same LAN. After that, we will explore additional features including voicemail, Interactive Voice Response (IVR), conference rooms, and other advanced capabilities. Finally, we will discuss best practices for securing VoIP communications within a LAN environment.

## Environment Setup

For this project, the following components are required:

- A virtualization platform (VirtualBox or VMware)
- A Linux operating system distribution (Ubuntu is recommended)
- Asterisk software

You can follow the tutorial below to set up the lab environment and install Asterisk:

## Starting The Service : 

To start the Asterisk service on Linux, use the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl start asterisk

```
After starting the service, verify that it is running correctly and without errors:
```bash
sudo systemctl status asterisk
```

Once the service is confirmed to be active, you can access the Asterisk Command Line Interface (CLI) using the following command:
```bash
sudo asterisk -rvvv
```

## SIP Users Configuration :

First, we need to configure the `pjsip.conf` file located in `/etc/asterisk`.

The `pjsip.conf` file is the core of SIP communication in recent Asterisk versions.
It defines SIP users, their authentication details, contact addresses, and network transport (UDP, TCP, TLS, etc.).
Each user is represented by multiple sections (endpoint, auth, aor, transport), and every section starts with `type=....`

First, open the configuration file using your preferred text editor. In my case, I am using Vim, so I run the following command:
```bash
sudo nvim /etc/asterisk/pjsip.conf
```
You will notice that the file already contains some default configuration. However, I prefer to start from a clean setup and configure everything from scratch.

To do this safely, we first create a backup of the original file:
```bash
sudo mv /etc/asterisk/pjsip.conf /etc/asterisk/pjsip.conf.bak 
```
This command simply renames the original file by adding the .bak extension, allowing us to keep it as a backup in case we need it later.
After that, we can run the first command again to open a new, empty pjsip.conf file and begin our custom configuration.

---

### Global Section

At the top of the file, we define the **global** section. This section sets general parameters for Asterisk’s SIP stack.

In this case, the `user_agent` option specifies the name and version that Asterisk will advertise to other SIP devices during SIP communication.

```bash
[global]
type=global
user_agent=Asterisk20
```

Here, `user_agent=Asterisk20` informs other SIP endpoints that the server is running **Asterisk version 20**.

---

### Transport Section

Next, we define the **transport** section. This section specifies how Asterisk sends and receives SIP messages over the network.

```bash
[transport-udp]
type=transport
protocol=udp
bind=0.0.0.0
```

This configuration tells Asterisk to:

- Use **UDP** as the transport protocol
    
- Listen on **all available network interfaces** (`0.0.0.0`)
    
- Use the **default SIP port (5060)**
    

---

### Endpoint Section

The **endpoint** section defines how Asterisk handles a SIP user. It includes parameters such as codecs, dialplan context, caller ID, transport method, authentication, and contact information (AOR).

```bash
[1001]
type=endpoint
transport=transport-udp
context=local
disallow=all
allow=ulaw,alaw,vp8,h264
callerid=Amine <1001>
```

This configuration defines a SIP user with ID **1001**:

- Uses **UDP** for transport
    
- Is associated with the **`local`** dialplan context
    
- Disallows all codecs by default, then explicitly allows `ulaw`, `alaw`, `vp8`, and `h264`
    
- Sets the caller ID to **“Amine <1001>”**
    

The endpoint will later be linked to its corresponding **authentication** and **AOR** sections.

---

### Authentication Section

The **auth** section defines the credentials that a SIP device (IP phone or softphone) must provide in order to register with the Asterisk server. This allows Asterisk to verify that the device is authorized.

```bash
[auth1001]
type=auth
auth_type=userpass
username=1001
password=1001pass
```

This section defines authentication for SIP user **1001**:

- Uses `userpass` authentication
    
- Requires the username `1001`
    
- Uses the password `1001pass`
    

---

### AOR (Address of Record) Section

The **AOR (Address of Record)** section defines where and how Asterisk can reach a SIP user. It specifies how many devices can register and helps Asterisk track the user’s current network location.

```bash
[1001]
type=aor
max_contacts=1
```

This configuration:

- Defines the AOR for SIP user **1001**
    
- Allows only **one device** to be registered at a time (`max_contacts=1`)
    

The `max_contacts` parameter controls how many devices can register using the same SIP account. For example:

- `max_contacts=1` → only one device
    
- Higher values → multiple devices can register simultaneously
    

---

### Multiple SIP Users

As shown, multiple SIP users can be defined in `pjsip.conf` by creating separate **`endpoint`**, **`auth`**, and **`aor`** sections for each user. By assigning each user a unique ID, username, password, caller ID, and AOR settings, Asterisk can manage all users individually and correctly route calls between them.

---

## Extensions Configuration: Dialplan

The `extensions.conf` file is the **core logic** of Asterisk. It controls how calls are handled, such as call routing, forwarding, voicemail, and other call features.

As we did before, we first make a backup of the default configuration file:

```bash
sudo mv /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf.bak
```

Then, we create and open a new `extensions.conf` file using our text editor:

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf
```

---

### Global Configuration

First, we define the **global settings** of the dialplan:

```ini
[general]
static=yes
writeprotect=no
```

The `[general]` section sets general options:

- `static=yes` means the dialplan is always loaded by Asterisk.
    
- `writeprotect=no` allows us to edit the file.
    

---

### Local Context

The `[local]` context is used for **internal extensions**. A dialplan tells Asterisk what to do when someone calls a specific extension.

```ini
[local]
exten => 1001,1,Dial(PJSIP/1001,20)
 same => n,VoiceMail(1001@default,u)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

When a user calls extension **1001**:

1. Asterisk tries to call SIP user `1001` for **20 seconds**.
    
2. If there is no answer, the call is sent to voicemail using `VoiceMail(1001@default,u)`.
    
3. Finally, the call ends with `Hangup()`.
    

---

### Link with `pjsip.conf`

**Important:** The extensions defined in the `[local]` context must match the SIP users defined in `pjsip.conf`.  
This allows Asterisk to know which SIP device belongs to each extension.

---

### Direct Access to Voicemail

Asterisk also allows users to access their voicemail directly using a special extension:

```ini
exten => 6000,1,Answer()
 same => n,VoiceMailMain(@default)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

When dialing **6000**, the user is connected to the voicemail system.  
`VoiceMailMain(@default)` opens the voicemail menu, where users can listen to messages and manage their mailbox.

---

### Voicemail Configuration

To use voicemail correctly, we need to configure the `voicemail.conf` file. This file allows Asterisk to **store voice messages** and gives users access to their **voicemail boxes**.

As done before, we first create a backup of the original file:

```bash
sudo mv /etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf /etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf.bak
```

Then, we open a new `voicemail.conf` file using our text editor:

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf
```

---

#### Voicemail Configuration Example

Below is an example of a basic `voicemail.conf` configuration:

```ini
[general]
format=wav
maxmsg=100

[default]
1001 => 1234,Katia
1002 => 1234,Nadia
1003 => 1234,Zaki
```

Explanation:

- The `[general]` section defines global voicemail settings.
    
    - `format=wav` sets the audio format used to save voicemail messages.
        
    - `maxmsg=100` defines the maximum number of messages per mailbox.
        
- The `[default]` section defines the voicemail boxes.
    
    - `1001`, `1002`, and `1003` are the mailbox numbers.
        
    - `1234` is the PIN code used to access the voicemail.
        
    - `Katia`, `Nadia`, and `Zaki` are the names of the users.
        

While not strictly required by the system, it is a best practice to ensure the mailbox number matches the extension used in the dialplan and the SIP user in pjsip.conf. This consistency ensures that Asterisk can easily route calls to the correct mailbox and allows users to manage their messages without configuration confusion.
